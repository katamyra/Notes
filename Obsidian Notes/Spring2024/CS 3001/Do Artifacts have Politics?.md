# Technical Arrangements and Social Order
* **Robert Moses** deliberately designed low bridges on and over parkways leading to Jones Beach (also designed by Moses)
	* He made it so that you needed to have a car to get in, so *only rich people could use it*
		* Buses couldn’t get into the park
	* If you consider those bridges and infrastructure as technology, then he was using technology to deliberately restrict technology
* **Technologies can be used in ways that enhance the power, authority, and privilege of some over others**
* **Technologies can take away jobs**
	* For examples, huge mechanical tomato harvesters took away a lot of jobs 

# Inherently Political Technologies
* “If you accept nuclear power plants, you also accept a techno-scientific industrial military elite. Without these people in charge, you could not have nuclear power”
