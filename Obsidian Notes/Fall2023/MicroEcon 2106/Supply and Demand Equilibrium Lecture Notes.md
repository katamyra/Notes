### Sensitivity to a Price Change
* For example, quantity demanded doesn't change much when gas prices increase, but quantity demanded changes a lot more when ice cream prices change
	* Makes sense, if ice cream prices go up you are a lot less likely to get it because its not a necessity 

### Elasticity
* If hotel increases room price 100 -> 250
	* Will they make more money bc/ more expensive rooms? Or lose money because less hotel rooms are sold?
	* **Elasticity** gives us the answer to this
* The same change in price can cause total revenue to rise or fall more or less depending on elasticity
	* If demand is **elastic**, a higher price yields less revenue
		* If demand is **inelastic**, a higher price yields more revenue
	* *Elastic* means a change in price quickly leads to a change in quantity demanded
* Price elasticity of demand = `(percent change in quantity demanded) / (percent change in price)`
	* The *price elasticity of demand* measures by what percent the quantity demanded changes in response to a 1% price change
	* The PED is negative
		* Movement along the demand curve follows the **law of demand**, and price and quantity changes always move in the opposite directions
* For now, use the absolute value
	* Absolute value focuses on the magnitude of the price elasticity of demand
* EX: When Uber cut fares in NYC by 15%, it found that demand for rides increased by 30%
	* PED = |30%/-15%| = 2
	* This means they are sensitive to a change in price, so this demand is **elastic**
* *Rules for PED values:*
	* **Elasticity > 1** -> people are sensitive to a change in price
		* Demand is **elastic**
		* The percent change in quantity is *larger* than the change in price
		* Price is very responsive to changes in price
			* Demand curve is relatively *flat*
	* **Elasticity < 1** -> people are not sensitive to a change in price
		* Demand is **inelastic**
		* The percent change in quantity is *smaller* than the percent change in price
		* Price is not responsive to changes in price
		* Demand curve is relatively *steep*
* Low PED value means even if it the price goes up a lot, it wont affect u as much
* The percentage change from going to x --> y and y --> x is different values (bc/ different directions)
	* For this, use *midpoint equation*
	* Percentage change in quantity = `(Q2-Q1)/((Q1+Q2)/2) * 100`
### Types of Demand Curves
* **Horizontal demand curve:**
	* Usually happens when theres a lot of substitutes nearby, so if the price changes for one, consumers will just go elsewhere
* What determines the shapes of demand curves and now elastic/inelastic products are?
	* The price elasticity of demand reflects the *availability of substitutes*
	* It is *larger* in the following circumstances
		* when there are more competing products
		* for specific brands rather than broad categories
			* this is because you can always choose other brands
		* for things that aren't necessities 
		* when consumers search more
			* better information makes you more price elastic
		* when theres more time to adjust to a situation
		* price relative to budget (**not in the book**)
			* for items that are a trivial amount of money you are unlikely to care much
* *2 Effects of a Price Increase*
	* More revenue per unit sold (Price Increase)
	* Fewer units sold (Quantity Demanded decreases)
	* Elasticity tells us which effect dominates
* *Think of Elasticity as a Ratio (rather than a number)*
	* e = 2 = (2% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (1% change in Price)

### Elasticity & Total Revenue
* If you are in the are in the elastic portion of the curve then lowering price can give a lot extra revenue, and the opposite for the other way
	* It depends on the context, and theres a point that has the highest revenue
* **Cross Price Elasticity of Demand** measures how sensitive quantity demanded is to price changes of other goods
	* It measures the percentage change in quantity demanded that follows from a 1% price rise in another good
		* This is positive for **substitutes**
		* This is negative for **complements**
	* For this, DONT take absolute value
	* Cross price elasticity of demand = percent change in quantity demanded / percentage change inprice of another good
* **Income Elasticity of Demand**
	* Measures how sensitive quantity demanded is to changes in *income*
	* It measures the percent change in quantity demanded following a 1% rise in income
	* This is negative for inferior goods (ramen, fast food, and positive for normal goods (meals at nice restaurants)
* **Price Elasticity of Supply**
	* The price elasticity of supply measures how responsive sellers are to price changes
	* Measures by what percent the quantity supplied will increase following a 1% price increase
		* Determinants of Price Elasticity of Supply
			* Depends on how flexible your business can be
			* It is larger for firms that can store larger inventories,
			* Or when inputs are easily available
				* Ex restaurants can easily buy more food/silverware if business is booming
