# 9.1 - Comparative Advantage is the Foundational of International Trade
* People choose to **import**, or buy goods and services from foreign buyers when they can make more money than they would if they just sold them in the United States
* American businesses choose to **export**--that is, sell their goods or services to foreign buyers–when they can make more money than they would if they just told them in the United States
## Comparative Advantage and International Trade
* You can get a better deal by trading with foreigners for the same reason that you get a better deal by trading with people within your country
	* Its all related to *comparative advantage*, since the logic of comparative advantage makes *borders irrelevant*
		* The idea of assigning tasks to those with the lowest opportunity cost is no less persuasive if the people who have the lower opportunity cost happen to live in another country
	* **Comparative advantage drives international trade**
## What Get Traded?
* Comparative advantage yields a pretty stark piece of advice: Produce what you’re good at and buy what you aren’t
* **Trade costs determine whether it’s worth buying or selling international**
	* *Trade costs* are the extra costs–aside from price–incurred as a result of buying or selling your goods internationally
		* Ex: shipping costs, or extra taxes
	* **Trade costs limit how important international trade is in your sector**
		* If a product has high trade costs, then it’s unlikely that importing or exporting the good will pass the cost-benefit test
## Choosing Your Trading Partners: Sources Of Comparative Advantage
* Its a good bed that trade costs will continue to fall, making international trade an even more important force through your center
* Economists have identified three factors that shape your comparative advantage: relatively abundant inputs, specialized skills, and the benefits of mass production
* **Source 1: Abundant inputs-Take advantage of what you have, to get what you want**
	* New Zealand has lots of land, and so New Zealand farmers can raise sheep and export wool at a relatively low cost
	* Canada has ample forests, and so Canadian foresters export wood and related products like paper
* **Source 2: Develop a specialized skill**
	* Your unique skills, production methods, or expertise can be an important *source of comparative advantage*
		* If you focus on a specific product for a long time, you’ll likely discover new production techniques that will lower your costs
* **Source 3: Exploit the benefits of mass production**
	* Ikea sells millions of Billy bookcases each year to buyers all around the world
		* Bookcases are so inexpensive because Ikea sells so many of them
	* *When creating a lot of something, you can invest in creating highly specialized production lines that are much more efficiently*
# 9.2 - How International Trade Shape Your Markets
## The World Market
* **World supply and world demand determine the world price**
![[Screenshot 2023-10-23 at 11.36.48 PM.png]]
* **When the United States is a small player, take the world price as given**
	* Realize that the US is only a small player in the global shirt market, so they are *price takers*
## How Imports Change Your Market
* The **domestic demand curve** illustrates the quantity of goods that domestic buyers–that is all Americans take together–play to buy at each price
* The **domestic supply curves** illustrates the quantity of goods that domestic producers plan to sell at each price
* **Evaluate the equilibrium when theres no trade**
	* To set a baseline for the comparison, we’ll start by assessing the likely outcome if there were no trade. As before, its about where supply meets demand
* **3 Step Process**
	* *Step 1: Figure out the new price*
		* When you can buy goods from abroad, you have new options to consider. For instance, international trade gives buyers the option to import shirts at the world price of 12. As a result, no US buyer will ever pay a seller more than 12 for a shirt. *For traded goods, the price is equal to the world price*
	* *Step 2: Determine the quantities demanded and supplied by domestic buyers and sellers at this price*
		* To find the responses of Americans to this new lower price, consult their domestic demand and domestic supply curves
	* *Step 3: Assess the quantity that will be traded*
		* International trade makes up the gap between the quantity demanded by domestic buyers and the quantity supplied by domestic sellers
		* In this case, Americans want to buy more shirts than Americans producers supply, and so imports make up the difference
	* **Imports lead to lower prices, less domestic production, and more domestic consumption**
		* The prices declines to the world prices
		* This lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied by domestic sellers, but a higher demanded by domestic buyers
		* Imports fill the gap between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied
## Imports Raise Economic Surplus
* US Consumers gain when they import their shirts, because they get lower prices
	* But US producers lose, because foreign competition forces them to lower their prices of lose customers
	* The **cost-benefit principle** suggests that policy makers should make decisions about trade policy based on whether the gains exceed the losses
![[Screenshot 2023-10-24 at 12.21.27 AM.png]]
* **Start by assessing economic surplus when theres no international trade to set a baseline**
	* In this case, the no-trade equilibrium occurs where the domestic supply and demand curves cross
	* The consumer surplus is where they get to buy a shirt that is lower than their marginal benefit, so this is **the area below the domestic demand curve but above the price**, this is A
	* The producer surplus is **the area above the domestic supply curve but below the price**, this is B + C
* So the total economic surplus is the area A + B + C. This is the baseline. Now what happens if we allow trade?
* **Lower-priced imports raise consumer surplus**
	* Allowing imports leads domestic buyers to pay a lower prices, and at this lower price they buy a larger quantity of these low priced shirts
		* And so consumer surplus increases to A + B + D
	* At the same time, **domestic producers lower producer surplus due to producer surplus**
		* So their producer surplus does from B + C to just C
* **The benefits exceed the costs,  and imports raise total economic surplus**
	* Overall, we get a net gain of the area D
* **Recap: Consequences of allowing imports**
	* Competition from foreign sellers causes the price of goods we import to fall, and buyers respond by raising the quantity demand while sellers reduce the quantity they supply, with imports filling the difference.

## How Exports Change Your Market
![[Screenshot 2023-10-24 at 12.36.10 AM.png]]
* **Use the three-step recipe to evaluate how exports shape domestic markets**
	* Step 1) Figure out the new price
		* *For traded goods, the price is equal to the world price*
	* Step 2) Determine the quantities demanded and supplied by domestic buyers and sellers at this price
		* To do this, put a line for the new price and check the new supply and demand
		* Supply will be higher than demand
	* Step 3) 
		* Exports make up the gap between the quantity supplied by domestic sellers and the quantity demanded by domestic buyers
* **Exports lead to higher prices, more domestic production, and less domestic consumption**
	* The price rises to the world price
	* This higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied by domestic sellers but a lower quantity demanded by domestic buyers
	* Exports fill the gap between quantity supplied and the quantity demanded
