# 3.1 - Individual Supply - What you Sell, at Each Price
* An **individual supply curve** is a graph that shows the quantity that a business plans to sell at each price; it summarizes a business's selling plans
	* You can graph an individual supply curve for anything that you might sell
		* Space in your garage, the use of your electric scooter, your tutoring services
* *An individual supply curve holds other things constant*
	* Of course, the *interdependence principle* reminds us that other things than price can influence supply, but for now we hold everything constant just to see how only price affects everything
* *The individual supply curve is upward-sloping*
		* Notice that the individual supply rises upward as you look from left to right, which makes sense because at higher price 
* **Law of Supply**: this law means that supply curves are upward-sloping, because higher prices are associated with larger quantities
# 3.2 - Your Decisions and Your Individual Supply Curve
* **Perfect competition**: the special case in which all businesses are selling an identical good AND there are many sellers and many buyers, each of whom is small relative to the size of the market
	* *Perfectly competitive forms are price-takers, following the market price*
	* In a perfectly competitive market, your best strategy is to charge a price that is pretty much identical to whatever your competitors are charging
	* Generally, sellers in perfectly competitive markets shouldn't think about price too much because undercutting wont yield as many profits usually, so instead they act as **price-takers**, simply taking the price as given
* Not all markets are perfectly competitive
	* For this course however, we consider only perfectly competitive markets
* Choosing the Best Quantity to Supply 
	* Apply the core principles yo your supply decisions
		* Marginal principle
			* **YOUR MARGINAL COSTS INCLUDE VARIABLE COSTS BUT EXCLUDE FIXED COSTS**
				* As you think about what expenses to include, you should also consider the *opportunity cost principle*, aka: so what?
				* If you increase production, you have to worry about extra oil, paying extra wages, etc, and these are called **variable costs**
					* Costs such as top manager payment, etc don't change based on quantity/production and are therefore **fixed costs**
		* Cost benefit principle
		* Opportunity cost principle
		* Interdependence principle
* **The Rational Rule for Sellers in Competitive Markets**
	* Sell one more unit if the price is greater than (or equal to) the marginal cost
	* This puts together the advice from three of the four principles in one sentence
		* Follow this rule to maximize your profits
	* The reason you sell even if it is exactly equal to the marginal cost is only because it makes the rest of your analysis a bit simpler
	* Keep selling until price equals marginal cost
		* If you follow this rule consistently, you'll continue to raise the quantity you supply 
	* *Your supply is also your marginal cost curve*
		* Your supply curve reveals your marginal costs
			* As you increase the quantity you produce, the marginal cost of producing an extra gallon of gas rises
			* This increasing marginal cost reflects bottlenecks that arise when you try to expand production
			* Expanding your production requires increasing your use of inputs, like labor
		* Over time, if you hire new workers they will have less experience and take longer to get things done, you wont be able to find as fertile land, research is harder as they cant find things anymore, etc these can all lead to extra inputs being added not as effective or good as before, so your marginal costs rise
* How Realistic is This Theory of Supply?
	* **As sellers experiment, they may come to act as if they follow the core principles**
		* Many sellers, particularly smaller businesses, can't or won't engage in the kind of deep analytics used by bigger companies
		* Instead, they experiment with quantity, producing a bit more or a bit less each week to see how it affects their profits
	* **Survival of the Fittest weeds out bad manager**
		* Theres an evolutionary rule that leads most businesses to follow the *Rational Rule For Sellers* since it leads businesses to maximize profits
	* **Thinking through the principles provides useful advice and helpful forecasts**
		* The rule also helps predict the future for forecasts
# 3.3 - Market Supply
* **Market supply is the sum of the quantity supplied by each seller**
	* If all the suppliers are quite similar, you can just multiply one businesses supply curve by the number of businesses since this will be around the same
* **The Market Supply is upward sloping**
	* *Reason 1:* A higher price leads individual businesses to supply a larger quantity
	* *Reason 2:* A higher price means more businesses are supplying their goods and services; a lower price means fewer businesses are doing so
		* A higher price means that its more profitable to be a supplier in your industry, so more businesses are started relating to that
* *Movements Along the Supply Curve*
	* The market supply curve is useful because it aggregates and summarizes the behavior of their competitors
# 3.4 - What Shifts Supply Curves
* **The Interdependence Principle and Shifting Supply Curves**
	* The *interdependence principle* reminds you that your best choice as a sellers depends on many other factors beyond just the price
	* **The Five Factors**:
		* *Input Prices*
			* When you supplier changes the prices of your inputs, they change your marginal costs, which shifts your supply curve
			* More generally, changes in any input price will cause your supply curve to shift
		* *Productivity and Technology*
			* Productivity growth (producing more output with fewer inputs) is a key force reducing marginal costs through time
				* Often driven by technological change
				* Naturally people become more productive over time (learning by doing as managers learn what does and doesn't work)
		* *Prices of related outputs*
			* There are also connections between markets that are emphasized
			* As a supplier, your decisions are interdependent because there are many different lines of business you could engage in
				* For example, BP can use its oil refineries to produce gasoline or to produce alternative products such as diesel fuel (if thats more profitable)
				* When the price of goods like diesel decreases your supply of another (like gasoline), we call them **substitutes-in-production**
				* By contrast, goods that are **complements-in-production** are commonly produced together
					* For instance, asphalt is a natural byproduct of refineries, so if the price of asphalt rises, it becomes more profitable to operate a refinery
		* *Expectations*
			* Your decisions are also linked through time
			* if you expect the price of your product to rise next year, you can increase your profits by storing it and selling it next year 
		* *The type and number of sellers*
			* If new sellers enter the market, then the supply from the new sellers will be added to the market supply
			* The type of sellers matter too, because the market supply adds up the total amount supplied by all the sellers in the market
