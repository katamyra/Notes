# 5.1 Price Elasticity of Demand
* The *price elasticity of demand* measures how responsive buyers are to price changes
	* Specifically, it measures by what percent the quantity demanded will change in response to a 1% price changes
	* *price elasticity of demand* = (percent change in quantity demanded / percent change in price) 
	* **Absolute value focuses on the magnitude of the price elasticity of demand**
		* Economists often want to focus on the magnitude of the price elasticity of demand
	* When quantity is very responsive, *demand is elastic*
		* This is when the absolute value of the percent change in quantity demanded is large than the absolute value of the percent change in price
			* This is equivalent to saying *peod > 1*
		* When demand is elastic, price increase also lead to large changes in quantity demanded
	* When quantity is unresponsive, *demand is inelastic*
		* This is when *peod < 1*
	* Exactly equal to one PEOD is neither elastic or inelastic
		* Known as *unit elastic*
	* **Elastic demand curves are relatively flatter than inelastic demand curves**, since when price changes (y axis), demand changes a lot (x axis) so the curves are flatter
