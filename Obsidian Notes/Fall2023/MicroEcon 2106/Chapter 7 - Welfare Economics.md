	# 7.1 - Evaluating Public Policies
## Positive and Normative Policy Analysis
* **Stage 1**: Positive analysis describes what *will* happen 
	* What will happen if we adopt this policy? Eg. a **purely objective analysis** that describes and forecasts the effects of this policy
* **Stage 2**: Normative analysis describes what *should* happen
	* Which is the better outcome, and what policy should the government adopt?
	* Answering this question requires a value judgement about which outcome is better
* For example: should the minimum wage be raised?
	* Positive analysis is helpful because it lays out the likely consequences of the policy and who will gain and lose, etc
	* However, to assess whether a policy is worth pursuing, you need to evaluate whether the gains to some people outweigh the losses to others, and that requires some sort of value judgement
## Efficiency and Equity
* If you’re going to take a position in policy debates advocating what the government should do, then you’re going to need a way to judge which policy yields better outcomes
	* Aka, we need a way to evaluate how a policy effects ones **welfare**
* **The outcome that yields the most economic surplus is the most efficient outcome**
	* Economists often use *economic efficiency*, which basically just says that the more economic surplus thats generated, the better the outcome
		* ***economic surplus:*** the benefit that follow from a decision, less the costs you incur
	* **Efficient outcomes won’t make everyone happy**
		* Increasing economic efficiency rarely makes everyone happy, because most policies help some people but harm others
	* **Efficient outcomes** hold the potential to make everyone better off
		* One argument for focusing on efficiency is that whenever economic surplus rises, its possible for those who benefit to compensate those who were harmed in a way that makes sure everyone’s better off
* **Equity is also important (but ignored by efficiency)**
	* Real world policy debates are rarely about efficiency alone, they also are about **equity**, which means they are concerned with whether a policy will yield a fair distribution of economic benefits
# 7.2 - Evaluating Economic Surplus
## Consumer Surplus
* When you gain economic surplus from buying something, this is referred to as **consumer surplus**, because you’re earning that surplus in your role as a consumer
	* This is when you buy something for a cheaper price than the marginal benefit you gain from it
	* **Consumer surplus is your marginal benefit, less the price**
* *Consumer surplus is the area below the demand curve and above the price*
*![[Screenshot 2023-10-22 at 2.29.43 AM.png]]
* *You earn consumer surplus on all but your last purchase*
	* On your last purchase, marginal benefit of the last pair is *equal* to the price, so theres no marginal benefit
* In general, we enjoy a lot of consumer surplus in our life
## Producer Surplus
* Consumer surplus tells us about the gains that buyers get from a trade, but producers can also gain something, which is known as the **producer surplus**
	* Producer surplus is the price minus the marginal cost. This is basically just what sellers gain from selling something
* **Producer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the price**

* *You earn producer surplus on all but your last sale*
## Voluntary Exchange and Gains from Trade
* Voluntary transactions create **both consumer and producer surplus**, meaning both the buyers and sellers gain from the trade
	* Trading/selling is not a *zero sum game*, and can actually be a win-win situation
* **Voluntary exchange ensures both buyers and sellers enjoy gains from trade**
* Markets area bout competition and cooperation both
	* Markets aren’t just competition, but also cooperation because buyers and sellers work together
* Since economic surplus is marginal benefit minus marginal cost, this means **economic surplus is the area between the demand and supply curves**

# 7.3 -  Market Efficiency 
* *Markets are the central organizing institution of our lives* 
	* They determine which products are made, how much is produced, who makes what, who gets what, etc
	* Most countries prefer market based economies because markets yield more efficient outcomes 
## Who Makes What?
* How do we know which businesses should produce which products?
	* **Efficient production minimizes costs**
		* Supply and Demand lead companies to divvy up total production in such a way as to ensure that it occurs at the powers possible cost
		* This is how competitive markets lead to efficient production in which each item is produced at the lowest possible cost
	* **Markets distribute production across firms in a way that minimizes costs**
## Who Gets What?
* **Efficient allocation maximizes benefits**
	* An *efficient allocation* occurs when goods are allocated to create the largest economic surplus from the allocation
		* This means that goods go to the person that gets the highest marginal benefit from it 
## How Much Gets Bought and Sold?
* **The Rational Rules says to produce until marginal benefit equals marginal cost**
	* This means that the *forces of supply and demand produce the surplus maximizing quantity* automatically
	* Its almost like there is an **invisible hand** directing all economic activity into being efficient
# 7.4 - Market Failure and Deadweight Loss
* Our supply and demand curves represent well-informed buyers and sellers interacting in a well functioning market with perfect competition 
	* However, the real world doesn’t always work this perfectly
## Market Failure
* In reality, supply and demand doesn’t always work as smoothly as one would one
* **Market failure** is when the forces of supply and demand lead to an inefficient outcome
* There are *5 main factors for market failure*
	* **Market Failure 1: Market power undermines competitive pressures**
		* The problem of *market power* arises when markets don’t meet the perfectly competitive ideal of many sellers selling identical products. Instead some markets are only dominated by a few handful of companies, such as Laptop brands
			* These companies can take advantage of this and charge higher prices, leading to consumers buying smaller quantity 
			* This then leads to underproduction as businesses with market power tend to produce less than the efficient quantity
	* **Market Failure 2: Externalities create side-effects**
		* The problem of *externalities* arises whenever the choices that buyers and sellers make have side effects on others
			* For example, many utilities produce electricity by burning coal, which has side effects including smog, acid, rain, etc. You are affected by these side effects. even if you don’t buy or sell coal
			* Businesses tend to produce more than the efficient quantity of products with negative side effects
	* **Market Failure 3: Information problems undermine trust**
		* The problem of private information can arise when you’re worried that the folks you’re doing business with know something you don’t
			* For example, if a seller knows more about the quality of the used cars they’re selling than you do, you might wonder why they’re selling it
		* Its an example of how *private information* (information one side has but not the other), can undermine trust and lead people to buy or sell less than the efficient quantity
	* **Market Failure 4: Irrationality leads to bad decisions**
		* Sometimes people make decisions that aren’t in their best interest
		* If buyers don’t follow the **Rational Rule for Buyers**, or sellers don’t follow the **Rational Rule for Sellers**, their supply decisions may not be driven by their marginal costs, and so efficient production is unlikely
	* **Market Failure 5: Government can impede market forces**
		* Government regulations can impede market forces
			* Taxes on buying or selling stuff leads a lower quantity to be bought or sold. Likewise regulating the price sellers can charge or limiting the quantity they can sell also changes the quantity sold
		* Sometimes government regulations create their own distortions, pushing the market away from the efficient quantity
## Deadweight Loss
* The idea behind **deadweight loss** is that the cost of market failure can be measured by calculating how much it reduces the economic surplus
	* `Deadweight Loss = Economic surplus at efficient quanaity - actual economic surplus`
* **Economic surplus and deadlight loss focus on marginal benefits and marginal costs**
	* Economic surplus = Marginal Benefit - Marginal Cost
	* Often when we measure economic surplus, we use a shortcut: We look at the demand and supply curves. When there is no market failure, the demand curve corresponds with marginal benefits, and the supply curve corresponds with marginal costs. 
* **Producing less than the efficient quantity** creates a deadweight loss
![[Screenshot 2023-10-22 at 5.33.21 PM.png]]
* **Producing more than the efficient quantity also creates deadweight loss**
![[Screenshot 2023-10-22 at 5.34.02 PM.png]]
* **Deadweight loss looks like an arrowhead pointed at the efficient quantity**
	* **Quantities rather than prices are essential to measuring deadweight loss**

## Market Failure versus Government Failure
* **The efficiency of well-functioning markets points to the importance of market forces**
	* *We discovered that well-functioning competitive markets can do extraordinary thing*
		* They ensure that each good or service is produced by the business that can do so at the lowest possible marginal cost (*productive efficiency*), and that each good goes to the person who gets the most benefit from it
* **Market Failure points to an important role of government**
	* In reality, market failure is common, and that means that markets will typically produce somewhat worse outcomes than the ideal case. 
	* Therefore, the role of government should be to create policies that limit market failure
		* There are lots of debates about how big that role should be
* **Government failure limits the extend to which we should rely on government**
	* The existence of market failures don’t necessarily mean that the government will do better. Thats because of another problem, **government failure**, which exists when government policies lead to worse outcomes. 

# 7.5 - Beyond Economic Efficiency

## Critiques of Economic Efficiency
 * Focusing on economic efficiency can sound like a version of the argument that we should always choose the largest possible pie
	 * However, there are some critiques
 * **Critique 1: Distribution matters, and so it’s also important to account for equity**
 * **Critique 2: Willingness to pay reflects ability to pay, not just marginal benefit**
	 * Realize that economics often equate marginal benefits with your willingness to pay, but sometimes you really want something but you can’t afford as much as others can
 * **Critique 3: The means matter, not just the ends**
	 * Economic efficiency is all about outcomes, but we also need to look at the means to get there
 * *For these reasons, use economic efficiency cautiously. Use it carefully, aided by a clear sense of its precise meaning
