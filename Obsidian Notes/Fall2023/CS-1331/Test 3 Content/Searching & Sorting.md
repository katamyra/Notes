> **Worst Case**: Element is in last index or element doesn’t exist
> **Best Case**: Element is in first Index

> [!info] Binary Search
> Determines which half of the set the date is in, and then divides the subset in half and repeats until reaching the item. *Only works if the list is sorted*

>[!info] Selection Sort
>***Procedure:*** For each sub-list (i → n-1), find and select the smallest (or largest) element and swap it with the first element in the sublist
>
>**Big O for Selection Sort**: O(n^2). This is because there are two for-loops, one to select an element and one to find the min value in the sub-list
