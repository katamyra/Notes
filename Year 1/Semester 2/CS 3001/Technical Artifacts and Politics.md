* There is a claim that the machines, structures, and systems of modern material culture can be accurately judged not only for their contribution to efficiency and productivity and their positive and negative environmental side effects, *but also for the way in which they can embody specific forms of power and authority*
* People insist that the biggest and best that science and industry made available were the guarantees of democracy, freedom, and social justice
	* The factory system, automobile, telephone, etc have all at one time or another been described as democratizing, liberating forces
		* Ex: phone had the power to disband armies, to cashier presidents, to create a whole new democratic world
* It is no surprise to learn that technical systems of various kinds are deeply interwoven in the conditions of modern politics
	* The physical arrangements of industrial production, warfare, communications, and the like have fundamentally changed the exercise of power and the experience of citizenship
* At first glance, it seems to say that certain technologies *in themselves* have political properties seems at first glance completely mistaken
	* **What matters is not technology itself, but the social or economic system in which it is embedded**. This is called the ***social determination of technology*** says that the social circumstances of a technologies deployment defines its politics
* However, there are important reasons to believe that technology is politically significant in its own right, good reasons why the standard models of social science only go so far in accounting for what is most interesting and troublesome about the subject
	* **Theory of technological politics:** draws attention to the momentum of large scale sociotechnical systems, to the response of modern societies to certain technological imperatives, and to the ways human ends are powerfully transformed as they are adapted to technical means
		* Basically, rather than just insist that we must look at social forces, we should look at the characteristics of technical objects and the meanings of those characteristics
		* Aka certain technologies are political phenomena in their own right
* How can artifacts contain political properties?
	* First are instances in which the invention becomes a way of settling an issue in the affairs of a particular community
	* Second are cases of *“inherently political technologies”*, or man-made systems that appear to require or to be strongly compatible with particular kinds of political relationships
