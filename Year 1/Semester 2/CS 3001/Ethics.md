# Ethical Frameworks
## Utilitarianism
* An action is good if the benefits of that action exceed the harm of that action
	* *Nothing to do with the attitude or intentions of an action*, purely the outcome of an action
* People use the trolley problem to defend utilitarianism 
* **Act Utilitarianism** is the idea that for every choice you make, you add up all of the pros and cons and decide if there was more positive or negative
	* Arguments for act utilitarianism:
		* It focuses on happiness
		* It is practical
		* It is comprehensible
	* Arguments against act utilitarianism
		* Where to draw the line in calculations?
		* Too much energy to put into every moral decision
		* Ignores innate sense of duty
* **Rule Utilitarianism**: the idea that we should all adhere to certain moral rules and if everyone follows those rules, it would lead to maximal happiness
	* The arguments for rule utilitarianism
		* Not every moral decision requires performing utilitarian calculus
		* Exceptional situations do not overthrow moral rules
		* Solves the problem of **moral luck** 
			* We make choices that should’ve produced more happiness than unhappiness, but sometimes you can get unlucky causing your action to produce more bad than good
		* Reduces **moral bias**
		* Appeals to the cross section of society
	* The arguments against rule utilitarianism
		* Forces use to use a single scale or measure to evaluate completely different kinds of consequences
		* It ignores the problem of an unjust distribution of good consequences
			* This is because util doesn’t focus on the fact that the “good” isn’t necessarily distributed evenly 
## Kantianism
* Basically u just ask what would the world be like if everyone did something, and that tells you whether or not u should do something
	* Not concerned with the outcomes
# How to Argue
 * What is an Argument?
	 * It is not a fight or quarrel
	 * It is not a pro-Con Debate 
 * They all sit somewhere between **truth-seeking and persuasion**, kinda like a spectrum
## Genres of Argument
* Letters to the editor
* Visual Arguments
* Documentaries
* Advocacy web sites

* When we read something, we need to see it as a **believer** and a **doubter** to see how it feels from both sides
