# What was the Therac-25
* A **linear accelerator** used to treat cancer w/ radiation therapy
	* Was a new digital version of the therac 6/20
		* This time, it had less hardware components and had a software interface 
	* It had malfunctions and would give too much radiation or not give enough radiation (bad bc/ need to treat cancer)
# Software Errors
* Two of the software errors were **race conditions**, which is an error when a device or system tries to perform multiple operations at once, but the orders must be done in a specific order to be correct
# Design Flaws
* HCI User Centered Design flaws in the system
* Design process flaws by reusing older code designed to work with a system that had manual overrides and locks
	* The flaws were system flaws too, not just software errors
* The system was not designed to be fail safe
* Lack of mechanism to detect overdoses
# Moral Responsibility
* In order for a moral agent to be held responsible, they need to meet these two conditions
	* **Casual condition** - the actions (or inactions) of agents must have caused the harm
		* Basically not *necessarily*  on purpose but still caused by the actions of that purpose
	* **Mental condition** - the actions (or inactions) must have been intended or willed by the agent
		* Basically happened on purpose
* *The tragedy was compounded by AECL not fully communicating with itâ€™s customers*
	* Hospitals continued to use the machines even after there were accidents
	* Nurses continued to operate machines even after there were accidents 
* **Our governments responses tend to be reactive instead of proactive**
