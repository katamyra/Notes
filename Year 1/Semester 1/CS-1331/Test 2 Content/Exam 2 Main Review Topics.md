## Classes and Methods
***Shadowing - (using this or super when needed in that case, but generally not recommended)***
* Not recommended
***Overriding***
* same name, different arguments (diff return types doesnt’ matter, need diff params?)
* Can only happen between a super/sub class
***Overloading***
* Can happen at in one class, or between a super/sub class 
* You CANNOT overload static methods
***Static/Instance Methods***

## Constructors
Chaining
Copy Constructor s

## Inheritance
Super Chaining
Multiple Interfaces
## Visibility Modifiers
## Wrapper Classes
## Abstract Classes
* do a lot of testing for edge cases, what works and what doesn’t?
* Abstract classes have to implement/define **ALL** abstract methods in the class, but not  the concrete methods and constructors
* 
## Polymorphism
**Static vs Dynamic** - this is many scuffed rn do a lot of testing
## Short Coding
Copy Constructor
Equals()

## Weird Topics
Knowing when something is a compile error vs a runtime error for polymorphism/visibility modifiers
