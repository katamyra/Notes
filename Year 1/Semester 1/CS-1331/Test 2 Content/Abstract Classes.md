* You <u> cannot instantiate abstract classes with <b>new </b> </u>
* Abstract classes can have concrete constructor
	* Yes
* Can a subclass be abstract even if its superclass is concrete?
	* Yes! This happens with every abstract class since they extend object
* Can a class **override** a method and declare it to be **abstract**
	* Yes!

>[!info] Making a class **final** prevents it from being extended. 
>Final classes can be used as a normal class, but cannot be extended anymore. Making a method *final* <u> prevents it from being overriden </u>
