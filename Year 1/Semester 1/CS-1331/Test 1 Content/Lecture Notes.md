* **Char:** any single char --16 bits
* ASCII - 8 bits, used in older languages
	* Java uses Unicode (16 bits) to represent more characters, including emojis
* **Literal values**
	* *Boolean literals*
		* `bool flag1 = true`
	* *Integer Literals*
		* `int decimalNumber = 42`
		* `int binaryNumber = 0b10010`
		* `int hexNumber = 0x2F`
		* `int hexNumber = 0x2F`
	* *Long Literals*
		* `long l = 10L`
* When initializing a float, you must do `float f = 123.456F`
	* You must add the F at the end or it doesn't work, since it is default double without adding an F
* Character is 16 bits (Unicode)
