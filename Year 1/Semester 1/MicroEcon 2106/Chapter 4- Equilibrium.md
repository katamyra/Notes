# 4.1 Understanding Markets
* A **market** is any setting that brings together potential buyers (demanders) and sellers (suppliers)
	* Markets are everywhere, organizing most of what we do 
	* Economists believe that markets play a role in your life beyond simply what you buy and sell 
		* For instance, as a voter, you're a supplier in the markets for votes. Even if the votes aren't actually bought or sold, it can be almost modeled as a market
		* Marriage market, you are looking to find the right person to become your spouse. In this market, the price is the promise you make about how much love and support you'll offer, and the effort you'll put into helping run your joint household
	* In each of these markets, outcomes are determined by the forces of supply and demand, so we can use the same economic framework to understand all of them
	* Indeed, the power of economic analysis is that supply and demand are the key forces shaping outcomes in many different kinds of markets
		* The supply and demand curves so far are most appropriate for markets with *perfect competition
		* Recall that perfect competition involves many buyers and sellers of an identical good, and each of these buyers is smaller relative to the full market

# 4.2 - Equilibrium
* In equilibrium, every sellers who wants to sell an item at the current price can find a buyer, and every buyer who wants to buy at the current price can find a willing seller
	* Because its balanced, theres no tendency for the market price to change when a market is in supply-equals-demand equilibrium
	* The price at which this happens is called *equilibrium price*, and the quantity is *equilibrium quantity*
### Supply Meets Demand
* The building blocks of our analysis will be market demand and supply curves
	* As you know, market demand and supply curves summarize the purchasing and producing decisions of all the participants in the market 
		* Where the lines meet is where the quantity supplies equals the quantity demanded
* To see if a market is in supply-equals-demand, see if the prices are changing, because that shows if its already in equilibrium or not
* There are three symptoms of a market in *disequilibrium*
	* **Queueing**: When driving around for a spot, you're effectively queueing, waiting in line, for the next available spot. The extra time you spend in the queue raises the effective price bc/ ur losing ur time
	* **Bundling of Extras**: When you bought dinner just so you could get the valet to park your car, you were buying extras so you could get what you wanted
	* **A secondary market**: parking in someones else's driveway is finding a way around the "official" market
# 4.3 - Predicting Market Changes
### Three step recipe for Predicting Market Outcomes
1) Determine which curve is shifting (demand, supply or both)
	1) Any change affecting buyers will shift the demand curve, any change impacting sellers will shift the supply curve
2) Determine if its an increase or decrease
3) Determine how prices and quantities will change in the new equilibrium
* **Rule 1**: If prices and quantities move in the same direction, then the demand curve has definitely shifted
* If prices and quantities move in opposite directions, then the supply curve has definitely shifted
