# 8.1 - Gains from Trade
* The benefits you get from reallocating stuff to its better uses are called the **gains from grade**
	* This is what markets do, they reallocate stuff-resources, goods, and services-to better uses, generating gains from trade
	* *Money is just a convenience that allows you to engage in more complicated trades*, but the code idea is the same as if you were trading for other stuff
		* When you sell an hour of your labor to your employ for 15 dollars and then use that 15 to buy food, you are effectively trading your time for food
# 8.2 - Comparative Advantage
* How should two roommates allocate tasks around their home?
	* Helen can vacuum in four hours, or make a meal in two hours
	* Jamie can vacuum in four hours, or make a meal in one hour
* **Absolute advantage** tells you who’s best at a task, but not who should do a ask
	* For example Helen argues Jamie should do all the household tasks because he is better at the tasks than her (*this is absolute advantage*)
	* However, this is wrong
* **Comparative advantage is all about opportunity cost**
	* To figure out the true cost of Helen or Jamie vacuuming the house, you need to ask “Or What?”. Jamie can vacuum the house, or spend that time making meals. 
	* *To get the most output with your given inputs, you should allocate each task to the person with the lowest opportunity cost*
		* The person with the lowest opportunity cost of completing a particular task has a **comparative advantage** at that task
* **Everyone has a comparative advantage**
	* Notice that Helen is better at neither cooking nor vacuuming than Jaime is. But still, her household is better off aspiring her to some task to nothing at all (more specific, the one that she’s least bad at relative to Jaime)
	* *Everyone has a comparative advantage in what you’re least bad at, even if you have no absolute advantage*
* ***A three step recipe identifies who has a comparative advantage in each task***
	* 1) Determine how long each task would take each person. This measures cost of producing each good, in hour
	* 2) Convert this into a measure of opportunity by calculating how much of the alternatives good you could have produced in that time
	* 3) Evaluate who has comparative advantage at each task by assessing who can produce each good at the lowest opportunity cost
## Comparative Advantage In Action
* **Use comparative advantage to assign workers to tasks**
	* Good managers use comparative advantage to figure how to assign their team members to different jobs
		* Your dentist probably doesn’t clean your teeth or take your X-rays
		* Senior lawyers rarely draft legal motions. Usually they draft that tasks to paralegals
		* Your hairdresser probably doesn’t wash your hair
## Markets Facilitate Gains from Trade
* **Markets offer the opportunity to specialize according to comparative advantage**
	* Markets help strangers exploit the gains from trade that come from specializing according to comparative advantage 
* **Comparative Advantage explains why there are gains from trade-in markets**
	* It also explains *why people specialize*, because it creates more gains from trades
	* **Do more of what you’re relatively good at, and less of the other stuff**
## Comparative Advantage Drives International Trade
* Comparative advantage explains how you benefit from specializing in some tasks and trading with others. This also explains why we trade with people in other countries, and hence explains *international trade*
	* *We trade with foreigners for the same reason we trade with locals*

# 8.3 - The Power of Prices
* Markets help allocate tasks in a way that gets the most out of the gains from trade. To do that, everyone needs to be able to focus on tasks for which they hold a comparative advantage.
	* This requires knowing where each resource-such as your time-has the most relative value. *This is where prices come in*
## Roles of Prices
## Role 1: A price is a message
* The recent quinoa fad took place far away from the farmers who are high in the Andes mountains, cut off from news about the rest of the world. How do they learn about food friends in the United States
* **The price acts as a messenger communicating the sharp increase in demand**
	* *The price is a message to potential suppliers*. It tells them that quinoa is valuable, so grow more
	* *The price is a message to potential buyers*. It tells them quinoa is scarce- buy less of it!
	* These messages help coordinate better outcomes.
## Role 2: A price is an incentive
* A high price is an incentive for **suppliers to increase production, because it creates new profit opportunities**
* A high price is an incentive for **buyers to consume less, which can have far-reaching effects**
* **A price provides an incentive for strangers to cooperate**
	* When the price of quinoa rose, quinoa farmers received a message that they should selling it.
## Role 3: A Price Aggregates Information
* A price also **aggregates information**, and learning how to interpret it will help you make better decisions
	* The clearest example of this involves **prediction markets**, in which people trade contracts whose payoffs are linked to whether an uncertain event occurs
* **The process of buying and selling also aggregates**
	* Prediction markets yield useful forecasts because prices aggregate information
	* For instance, someone in Wisconsin who sees a lot of yard signs and number stickers supporting the Democrat might buy stock, while someone in New Mexico who saw the candidate give a bad speech might sell it.
* **Market prices broadcast useful information**
	* The same idea applies in other markets and there are financial prices that yield valuable business intelligence
	* The prices of financial contracts linked to Federal Reserve decisions reveals the odds that interest rates will rise

# 8.4 - How Managers Can Harness Market Forces
## Internal Markets Allocate Resources
* **Internal markets** are markets that managers set up *within* their organization so that different divisions can buy and sell scarce resources
	* The idea is to harness more of the power of market forces to help businesses grow and become more profitable
	* **Markets solve the knowledge problem**
		* For example, the folks running Feeding America realized that they can set up and internal market to help allocate food to where it’ll be more useful
		* This avoids the **knowledge problem**, which is that the knowledge or information you need to make a good decision may be so broadly dispersed that its not available to any individual decision maker
	* *Use internal markets to allocate scarce resources*
