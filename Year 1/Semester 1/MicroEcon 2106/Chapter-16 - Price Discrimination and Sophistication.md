# 16.1 - Price Discrimination
* **Price Discrimination** is the strategy of selling the same product at different prices
	* One example is college, since people often pay different amount of tuition/board based on their family income
	* **Set prices close to (and just below) marginal benefit**. The maximum price a customer will pay is their **reservation price**. 
	* *So in this case, you should charge everyone as much as possible, which is their reservation price*. This strategy is called **perfect price discrimination**
		* Make every possible sale where a customer has a marginal benefit exceeding your marginal cost

* **Price discrimination leads to higher prices for some and lower prices for others**
	* *You an also offer selective discounts to induce new customers to buy your product*
## The Efficiency of Price Discrimination
* **Price discrimination increases the quantity you sell.** It increases the quantity you sell before offering selective discounts will induce additional purchases.
* **Selective discounts help solve the underproduction products.**
