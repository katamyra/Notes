# 10.1: Identifying Externalities
* Your decision to drive to work or to school isn't just about you because it affects other peoples (fumes, creating traffic, hazard to others from car accidents, etc)
	* Driving is not just about you, because it involves an **externality** – a side effect on bystanders whose interests aren’t fully taken into account
		* Externalities are important because *they lead to **market failure**, producing inefficient outcomes that aren’t in society’s best interest*
		* This failure arises when there are bystanders who are affected by your choice but who can’t easily shape them
## Types of Externalities
* A side effect that *harms* bystanders is called a **negative externality**
	* Some activities can also involve **positive externalities**, which are side effects that *benefit* bystanders
* **Negative externalities impose costs on others**
	* If I stand up at a concert, you wont be able to see the stage
	* Negative externalities create problems because people often make decisions without taking full account of the costs that those choices impose on others
* **Positive externalities generate benefit for others**
	* When you plant a tree, it’ll recycle carbon dioxide into oxygen improving air quality for everyone nearby
	* *Positive externalities sound like good things, but they still lead to market failure because people typically make decisions without taking the full account of the benefits they confer on bystanders*
		* As a result, they’ll do less of these socially useful activities than is in society’s best interests
* For example when you decide whether to get the Covid vaccine, you use the **cost-benefit principle**, comparing the cost of the vaccine to the benefit you receive 
	* Some people reckoned that they were unlikely enough to get a bad case of Covid that the benefit *to them* was smaller than the cost
		* But that is not the best choice for their *community*, since it helps to stop the spread of virus within their community too
	* This is why the tendency to ignore or underestimate benefits that accrue to bystanders leads people to do fewer of those activities associated with positive externalities than is in society’s best interest
* **A price change is not an externality**
	* If price changes and a buyer or seller is harmed, then this still benefits the other party, so it balances out
		* Price changes are just a *redistribution* between buyers and sellers
## The Conflict Between Private Interest and Society’s Interest
* Externalities create tension between your personal or private interest and society’s interest
* **Negative Externalities Create External Costs**
	* Sellers rarely focus on the full set of marginal costs because they’re not on the hook for all of them. This is because there are *two types of costs*
		* **Marginal private costs** are the extra costs that the sellers incur to produce one more unit
		* **Marginal external costs** are the costs imposed on bystanders from producing one more unit (such as polluted air, etc)
		* **Marginal social costs = Marginal private cost + Marginal external cost**

* **Positive externalities create external benefits**
	* Buyers decisions are guided by the extra benefits that accrue to them, and these are called the **marginal private benefits**
	* **Marginal external benefits** are the extra benefits enjoyed by bystanders
	* Because buyers don’t enjoy marginal external benefits, they tend to ignore them, or undervalue them, when making demand decisions
	* *Marginal social benefit = Marginal private benefit + Marginal external benefit*

# 10.2 - The Externality Problem
## The Rational Rule for Society
* W'e’re trying to find the **society optimal quantity**, which is the quantity that’s most efficient for society as a whole, taking account of *all* costs and benefits
* ***The Rational Rule For Society***: Produce until marginal social benefit equals marginal social cost
	* *Thus, the socially optimal quantity is when **marginal social benefit = marginal social cost**

## Consequences of Negative Externalities
* **Step 1: Predict the Equilibrium Quantity**
	* This is basically a supply and demand curve looking only at marginal private benefits and marginal private costs
![[Screenshot 2023-10-27 at 4.07.25 PM.png]]
* **Step 2: Assess the externalities**
	* Find the externalities and add them to the graph
![[Screenshot 2023-10-27 at 4.08.04 PM.png]]
* **Step 3: Find the socially optimal quantity**
	* The socially optimal quantity occurs when the marginal social benefit is equal to the marginal social cost
	* In this case, since there are no positive externalities, the demand curve is also the marginal social benefit curve
![[Screenshot 2023-10-27 at 4.10.01 PM.png]]
* **Step 4: Compare your forecast of the equilibrium quantity with the socially optimal quantity**
	* Finally, compare your forecast of what will happen with what’s in society’s best interest
	* In this, it shows us that **negative externalities are overproduced**
		* **The logic of this analysis extends beyond the market for gasoline, suggesting that any product involving negative externalities are overproduced**
		* *If people don’t take account of the external costs of their actions, they’ll pursue those actions too often*
* **There is a socially optimal quantity of pollution**
## Positive Externalities
![[Screenshot 2023-10-27 at 4.26.05 PM.png]]
* **This analysis shows that positive externalities are underproduced**

# 10.3 - Solving Externality Problems
* The externality problem can be summed up simply: worse outcomes occur when people don’t take into account the interest of bystanders
## Solution 1: Private Bargaining and the Coase Theorem
* Private bargaining can sometimes solve the externality problems
	* Get bystanders and interest parties in a room to negotiate
* Often these problems can be solved without government involvement
* **Side payments can solve externalities**
	* The idea is if someone else’s actions harm you, you can pay them to do something else instead
	* *The **Coase Theorem** explains why side payments work* 
		* It says that if people can bargain costlessly and legal rights are clear and enforced (to ensure that each side holds up their end of the deal)
* **Strategic investments can solve externality problems**
	* Strategic investments are another type of private bargain
		* For example, network providers see Google’s extra ad revenue as a positive externality but ignore it, which means they tend to under provide internet access
		* So google builds high speed wireless internet networks to reach people outside of major cities
	* **Mergers** can solve externality problems 
		* Google could also have merged with a network provider
* While private bargaining can solve externality problems when bargaining costs are low, private bargaining doesn’t work when **bargaining is difficult**
## Solution 2: Corrective Taxes and Subsidies
* An alternative approach to the externality approach to the externality problem uses prices to change the incentives of buyers and sellers
* **Corrective taxes can solve negative externalities**
	* A *corrective tax* can induce people to take account of the negative externalities they create
* How this works is the tax leads you to respond as if you were taking account of the marginal external costs
	* Thus, the tax effectively internalizes the externality by making the costs of the negative externality internal to the producers cost-benefit analysis
* **Set a corrective tax equal to the marginal external cost**
	* Imposing a tax leads suppliers to make choices based on their new marginal cost, which now coincides with the marginal social cost. Aka now we are making them act as if they care about both their private costs and external costs
* **Corrective subsidies can fix positive externalities**
	* For instance, insurance companies will often subsidize your purchase of an alarm system for your house or car
* **Lawsuits, norms, and social sanctions are like corrective taxes**
	* These are sort of like “correction taxes”, making you act as if you care about the external costs
* **A warm glow and social recognition are like corrective subsidies**, as they also make you seem like you care about positive benefits
* **Corrective taxes and subsidies fix distortion caused by market failures**, rather than distort them
## Solution 3: Cap and Trade
* An alternative to changing prices is instead to change the *quantity* of the harmful activity directly, by imposing a quantity regulations
* **Cap negative externalities using a quantity regulation**
	* This reduces the negative production
![[Screenshot 2023-10-27 at 5.16.17 PM.png]]
* Your choice between quantity regulation and taxes depends on what you know
* **Increase efficiency by allowing businesses to trade their permits**
	* When the governments sets a quota, it has to determine not only the socially optimal quantity for the whole market to produce, but also how much each individual supplier is allowed to produce
		* It can’t be equal because inefficient businesses would produce as much as efficient businesses
	* The solution is to issue each business a number of permits, where each permit gives the rights to produce a certain amount of outputs, and then allow the businesses to trade permits
* **Regulate pollution rather than output**
# FINISH THE REST OF 10.3 LATER I LOST MOTIVATION
# 10.4 - Public Goods and the Tragedy of the Commons
* In this section we talk about the externalities that occur when a product is **nonexcludable**, meaning that other people cannot easily be excluded from using it
	* When something is **nonrival**, one person’s enjoyment or use of it doesn’t subtract from another person’s enjoyment or use
## Public Goods and the Free-Rider Problem
* The **free rider problem** occurs when someone can enjoy the benefits of something without bearing the costs
	* For example, if you enjoy clean air, beautiful architecture, etc, you are probably free riding on the work of others
		* These are *non-excludable*, meaning you can’t prevent people who don’t pay for enjoying these benefits
	* Free riders don’t pay for the benefits they receive and are therefore bystanders, enjoying positive externalities
* **With nonrival goods, free riders enjoy positive externalities without hurting others**
	* If you clean your apartment, then you roommates will enjoy a tidy home, whether or not they helped. In this example, these benefits don’t come at any cost from you
* **When goods or services are rival and its easy to exclude those who don’t pay, theres no free-rider problem**
* ***Public goods* are nonrival goods suffering from the free-rider problem**
	* This is a nonrival good that is nonexcludable
	* Example: Private company offered to keep country safe from foreign invaders for just 20 per person per month. The problem was they realized they couldn’t exclude people who didn’t pay for this, which caused a free rider problem
* **Markets underproduce public goods**

## Solution 5: Government Support for Public Goods
* A simple solution to the underprovision of public goods is for **the government to purchase public goods for everyone to use**, paid from tax revenues
	* This is why military, police and public parks are all paid for out of our taxes, rather than being (under) produced by private businesses 
* *Three facts about public goods to know*
	* Just because the government provides something doesn’t mean that it is a public good
		* Mail (USPS) is excludable
	* Just because something is a public good doesn’t mean that the government should fund it
	* Just because the government should fund a public good doesn’t mean the government should provide it
		* Sometimes government should pay for private companies to do it instead
* **Public goods can be provided by communities**
	* Sometimes public goods occur on much smaller cases, so you “local government” should pitch in to make something happen
* **Businesses often try to turn public goods into club goods**
	* Because public goods are nonexcludable and nonrival it. is hard to monetize, which is why companies try to transform them into **club goods** by keeping non payers out
## Solution 6: Assign Ownership Rights for Common Resource Problems
* So far we’ve considered situations in which nonrival goods are nonexcludable, but what happens when rival goods are nonexcludable?
	* Goods that are rival but nonexcludable are **common resources**, with private gains but shared costs
	* Once you catch a fish, you privately benefit from eating it, but the cost (less fish) is shared by everyone
* **Common resources can lead to a tragedy of the commons**
	* This happens whenever rival goods are nonexcludable
	* To solve this, **assign ownership rights**
		* If someone, such as an individual, business, or organization owns a common resource, they will have an incentive to ensure that its not overused
		* The new owner of the commons might charge shepherds to graze their sheep, etc
* **Nonexcludable goods create externality problems**
	* When its a nonrival good, the free riders enjoyment doesn’t come at anyones expensive, they we have a **public good**
		* These are underfunded
	* When its a rival good, we get the tragedy of the commons, creating a *negative externality*
