> [!info] Let a != 0 and let b be integers
> If there is an integer *c* such that $b = ac$, then we say that a **divides** b 
> 
> A is called a **factor** of b
> B is called a **multiple** of b
> a | b denotes a divides b

***Examples:*** 

Does 3 | 7? No because 7 divided by 3 has a remainder.
Does 3 | 12? Yes because 12 divided by 3 has no remainder.

> [!info] The Division Algorithm
> **The division algorithm**: Suppose a is an integer and d is a positive integer. There are unique integers q and r, with 0 â‰¤ r < d, such that a = dq + r
