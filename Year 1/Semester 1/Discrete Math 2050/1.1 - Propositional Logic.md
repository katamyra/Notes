## Propositions
A **proposition** is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both

1) 7 - 4 = 3 --> is a proposition, is true
2) What is a vikings favorite food? --> not a prop bc/ not boolean
3) 8/2 = 5  --> is a proposition, is false
4) x = 7 --> is a proposition, cuz it says so??, could be argued as not prop though 
5) x + y = 3 --> is not a proposition, we don't know?

Conventional letters for propositional variables are **p, q, s, r**
* *"Thors hammer is named Mjolnir" could be denoted as *p*

The negation of p, or "it is not the case that p" is denoted by ¬p
* Examples:
	* Ronnie Likes Taco Bell.
		* r: ronnie likes taco bell
		* ¬r: ronnie doesnt like taco bell

### Conjunctions and Disjunctions
A  **conjunction** of p and q is the statement "p and q"
