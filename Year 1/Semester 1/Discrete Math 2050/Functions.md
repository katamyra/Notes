> [!info] Let A and B be nonempty sets. 
> A **function f from A to B** is an assignment of exactly one element of B to each element of A. We write f(a) = b if b is the unique element of B assigned by the function b to the element of a. If f is a function from A to B, we write f: A –> B
> 
> If F is function from A to B, we say that A is the *domain* of f and B is the *codomain* of f. If f(a)=b, we say that b is the **image** of a, and a is the **preimage** of b. The **range**, or image of f is the set of all images of elements of A.
> Also, if f is a function from A to B, we say that f maps A to B

Two functions are **equal** when they have the same domain, codomain, and map each element of their common domain to the same element in their common domain

A function is called **real-valued** if its codomain is the set of real numbers. Furthermore, they are called **integer valued** if its codomain is the set of integers. 

> [!info] Let f1 and f2 be functions from A to R.
> Then, f1 + f2 and f1f2 are also functions from A to R defined for all x belongs to A.

> [!info] One-to-One Functions
> Some functions never assign the same value to two different domain elements. These elements are said to be one-on-one
> 
> A function f is said to be **one-to-one**, or an *injection* if and only if f(a) = f(b) implies that a = b for all a and b in the domain of f. In this case, the function is *injective*.

> [!info] Increasing and Decreasing
> A function f whose domain and codomain are subsets of the set of real numbers is called **increasing** if f(x) ≤ f(y), and **strictly increasing** if f(x) < f(y), whenever x < y and x and y belong in the domain of f.
> 
> Similarly, f is called **decreasing** if f(x) ≥ f(y), and **strictly decreasing** if f(x) > f(y), whenever x < y and x and y are in the domain of f. 

> [!info] Onto Functions
> A function f from A to B is called **onto**, or a *surjection*, if and only if for every element b (belongs to B) there is an element a (belongs to A) with f(a) = b. A function is called *surjective* if it is onto.
> 
> Effectively, this means the range of the function equals the codomain (every element in the codomain is used)

If a function is both one-to-one and onto, the function is **bijective**

> [!info] Floor and Ceiling Functions
> The **floor function** assigns to the real number x the largest integer that is less than or equal to x. Ex: 3.5 –> 3
> 
> The **ceiling function** assigns to the real number x the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to x.
