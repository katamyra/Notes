In general, my motivation for being physical is multifaceted and takes many different forms. However, my largest motivator by far is for aesthetic purposes. I try to go to the gym 2 to 3 times a week in order to go more muscle and over time after gaining muscle go on a "cut cycle"  in order to remove some of my body and face fat. I think that aesthetics for most people is the most common motivator for working our, doing cardio, etc, and is an important way to convince people to become more healthy and active. However, it is important to acknowledge that that are some moral or ethical questions that come with using attractiveness as motivation for people to be healthy. Often, these motivators come at the expense of peoples insecurities, and even if they do progress their body to fit their ideals better, many people still experience body euphoria after this. Ethical dilemma, aside, I do believe improve attractive is a strong motivator, at least it is for me. 

Another large motivation for being active is that generally, I want to be stronger. I do feel as an 18 year old buy that an important part of becoming a man for be personally is getting stronger over time and having a larger build. Similar to this, I do in general take pride in being healthy in the sense that I have strong endurance in running and cycling, I walk a lot throughout the day, I generally had good mile times throughout my life, etc. It gives me a sense of pride and intrinsic happiness to feel healthy, and that helps motivate me to stay active. 

Another two big motivators for being active relate to a topic mentioned in the article "From a Vital Sign to Vitality: Selling Exercise So Patients Want to Buy It", which is that people often are more motivated when you have instant/soon gratification or instant "feel good" moments from being active. This takes place in two methods for me: results from working out, and both mentally and physically feeling better after working out. After working out, I often feel more awake and physically more comfortable, often making the rest of my day more productive and effective. Furthermore, I get proud of myself whenever I work out, and it helps me feel more happy and self-confident. Another way that I get to see results is by working out in cutting and bulking cycles. Since these are specialized cycles I often see results quickly which keeps me motivated to stay active. 

I think the most important factor within my environment that I need to stay active is being able to stay active alongside my friends. Not only does this make it much more fun to work out, but this also means that I have many friends to keep me accountable. Furthermore, it is important that staying active happens in "easy bits", meaning that is is a low time commitment thing that is easy for me to do and wouldn't be something I dread. I was reminded of this when reading the article "From a Vital Sign to Vitality: Selling Exercise So Patients Want to Buy It", *as it points out that people are more likely to work out if it seems easy to do and isn't too daunting*. I think as I get older, the main factor for staying healthy would not be for attractiveness or aesthetics, so I would need to find a new main reason to stay active. Honestly, off the top of my head I cannot really think of any main reasons for me to stay healthy when I am older, which might explain why older populations generally have a hard time staying active. Personally, I think that one of the main first reason that I would try to use to motivate myself is that when you are healthier, quality of life in general is much better, such as having better sleep and increased energy levels. 

There are multiple approaches I would take if I had to launch a campaign to increase physical activity on campus. First of all, as mentioned all throughout the article: we have focused too much on how exercise is good through the lens of clinicians and medical staff, but not much on how exercise can look good in the eyes of the ordinary public. I would focus less on health as the main reason for being active and more on reasons that would appeal the public more. This would include attractiveness, getting stronger, feeling good mentally and physically after working out, to name a few that I had mentioned to myself. Other similar reasons that could motivate people to be happy would be quality of life, increased energy levels, better mood, increased cognition, etc. 

Furthermore, I would want to focus on "feel good effects" in my campaign that make people excited to be active. The easiest way to do this would be through using specific wording in my campaigns, using words like "happy", "pleasure", and "time with family". The article mentions how pharmaceutical companies often do this because it is known for driving customer interest and creates the most desire, so I am confident it would work in aiding people to become more healthy and active.

One idea I had was to encourage being active in small bits throughout the day, rather than having to block out a specific time to exercise, which can often be challenging. However I think it easy to get in small bits of exercise throughout the day. For a tech student, maybe a certain number of pushups if you get a question wrong could be suitable. For others, maybe they can try to incorporate cardio into chores or tasks such as folding laundry, etc.
