This is a collection of all my Georgia Tech notes/discussion preparation/study guides.

Most of my preliminary notes are written on **Obsidian**, and are on the .md file format. Note: currently, images from these md files don't show when viewing from github.

More thorough compiled notes that I write to study for tests are stored in Compiled Notes/. These are compiled into PDF's primarily using Typst.
