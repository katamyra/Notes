= Virtue Ethics 
*Virtue ethics* can address the questions of how one should live, what kind of person one should become, and even what one should do in certain scenarios. Would a good person perform this action under this virtue? According to aristotle, happiness derives from living a life of virtue. 

In general, the other perspectives tend to not account for emotion and social relationships. 
#definition[
  *Virtues*: behaviors showing high standards. The qualities or states of character that find expression in morally good actions and morally good purposes.

  *Intellectual Virtues* - virtues associated with reasoning and truth 

  *Moral Virtues* - habits or dispositions formed through the repetition of relevant virtuous actions. _A deep seated character trait_. Not simple just a disposition to act a certain way but also to _feel_ that way.  
]

#definition[
  *Vices*: the opposite from virtues. A vice is a character trait that prevents a human being from flourishing or being truly happy
]

Usually, there are two vices for every virtue, because one corresponds to excess and the other corresponds to a deficiency.

Ex: Rashness #sym.arrow.l Courage #sym.arrow.r Cowardice

#note[
  Virtue ethics pays particular attention to the agent as well as the action and the consequences of the action. This touches on social contract theory, utilitarianism, and kantianism. _A good person does the right thing at the right time for the right reason_.

Also, according to virtue ethics, moral decision making cannot be reduced to the routine application of a set of rules. Basically, moral wisdom or discernment takes precedence over any rule. 

*Pros* 
- In many situations it makes more sense to focus on virtues than on obligations or rights 
- Personal relationships can be morally relevant to decision making 
- There are no irresolvable moral dilemmas 
- Recognizes the important of having a say in living a moral life 
*Cons*
- Different people may have quite different conceptions of what human flourishing is 
- Virtue ethics cannot be used to guide government policy
- Undermines attempts to hold people responsible for their bad actions
