= Virtue Ethics 
*Virtue ethics* can address the questions of how one should live, what kind of person one should become, and even what one should do in certain scenarios. Would a good person perform this action under this virtue?
#definition[
  *Virtues*: behaviors showing high standards. The qualities or states of character that find expression in morally good actions and morally good purposes. 
]
#definition[
  *Vices*: the opposite from virtues. A vice is a character trait that prevents a human being from flourishing or being truly happy
]

Usually, there are two vices for every virtue 

#note[
  Virtue ethics pays particular attention to the agent as well a the action and the consequences of the action. This touches on social contract theory, utilitarianism, and kantianism. _A good person does the right thing at the right time for the right reason_.
