= Intellectual Property
#definition[
  *Intellectual property* refers to creations of the mind: inventions, literary works, names and images used in commerce, etc.
]

A *trade secret* is a confidential piece of intellectual properly that protects a company with a competitive advantage, such as formulas, processes, and other information. In order to maintain its rights to a trade secret, a company must take active measures to keep it from being discovered.

Trade sets don't make sense for example for movies, since you wouldn't want a movie to be confidential.

A *trademark* is a word, symbol, picture, sound, or color used by a business to identify goods. A *service mark* is a mark identifying a service. 

A *patent* is how the US government provides IP for a limited period of time to creators of machines, systems and other inventions. A patent is quite different from a trade secret because a patent is a public document that provides a detailed description of the invention. 

After 20 years, anyone can make use of its ideas.

A *copyright* is how the US government provides authors with certain rights to original works they have written.

+ The right to display copies of the work in public
