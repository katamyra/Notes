= Social Contract


== Hobbes' Beliefs

Man is inherently _evil_. In order to avoid man's evil state of nature, rational people understand that some sort of social cooperation is only possible when people mutually agree to follow certain guidelines. 

#theorem[
  This leads to a *social contract* - the view that persons' moral and/or political obligations are dependent upon a contract or agreement among them to form the society in which they live.  
]

== Social Contract Theory 

#theorem[
  Hobbes argues that everyone in society has implicitly agreed to two things:
  + The establishment of a set of moral rules to govern relations among citizens 
  + A government capable of enforcing these rules
]

Hoobes believes that the morals derived from natural law do not permit individuals to challenge the laws of the sovereign, meaning that you cannot disobey the laws of the government.

== Rights

_Rights_ can be classified according to the duties they put on others

#definition[
  *Negative Rights* are rights that another can guarantee by leaving you alone to exercise your right. 
  - Right of free speech
  - Right to be safe 
  - Right to move around
  *Positive Right* - a right that obligates others to do something on your behalf  (guarantee of an action) 
  - Right to free education 
  - Community and national security
  *Absolute Right* - guaranteed without exception 
  *Limited Right* - may/can be restricted
]

*The Case For*:
- It is framed in the language of rights 
- It is based on a solid understanding of human nature, recognizing that rational people act ouf of self-interest in the absence of a common agreement 
- It explains why under certain circumstances civil disobedience can be the morally right decision 
*The Case Against*:
- None of us signed the social contract 
- Some actions can be characterized in multiple ways

*How do the philoshphies compare?*
_Reason for making a rule_: 
- *Utilitarianism*: it causes the greatest happiness for the most people
- *Kantianism*: it could be universalized for all people 
- *Social contract theory*: rational people would collectively accept it as binding because of its benefits to the community
