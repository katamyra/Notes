== Censorship

Censorship is the attempt to suppress or regulate public access to material considered offensive or harmful. 

*Direct Censorship*
- *Government monopolization* - government owns TV stations, radio, and newspapers. This has become harder due to the internet.
- *Prepublication review* - most governments have laws restricting the publication of information that harm national security 
- *Licensing and Registration* - begins as a means to control media with limited network bandwidth (radio station)
  - However, controlling bodies such as FCC also censor or ban content on platforms wishing to obtain licenses 

*Self Censorship*
- A group deciding for itself not to publish content for whatever reason. 

*Challenges posed by the internet*

+ The internet is dynamic 
+ The internet is huge 
+ The internet is global
+ It is hard to distinguish between children and adults on the internet 

== Mill's Principle of Harm 
However, a lack of government censorship can also lead to harm. 

#definition[
  *Principle of Harm*: the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. 

  Basically, the government should not get involved in the private activities of individuals, even if the individuals are doing something that harm themselves (only if it harms others)

== Freedom of Expression 

#blockquote[
  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for redress of grievances

#note[
  Freedom of expression is not an absolute right.

  Protection is not given to "libel, reckless or calculated lies, slander, misrepresentation, perjury, false advertising, obscenity and profanity, solicitation of crime, and personal abuse or fighting words"
