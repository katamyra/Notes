]

*Case For*:
- It focuses on happiness

- It is generally comprehensive 

*Case Against*: 
- Where to draw line in calculations? How bad is too bad if the end justifies the means?
- Takes a lot of time for each moral calculation

#definition[
  *Rule Utilitarianism* is the ethical theory that holds that we ought to adopt those moral rules that, if followed by everyone, lead to the greatest increase in total happiness over all affected parties
]

A _rule utilitarian_ chooses to follow a moral rule because its universal adoption would result in the greatest net increase in happiness. _This differs from kantianism because a rule utilitarian is still concerned with he consequences and not the motive_. 

*Case For*:
- Not every moral decision requires performing utilitarian calculus 
- Exceptional situations don't overthrow moral rules 
- Reduces problem of *bias*(?)
  - idk what this means
*Case Against*: 
- It forces us to use a single scale or measure to evaluate completely different kinds of consequences 
- It ignores the problem of an unjust distribution of good consequences
