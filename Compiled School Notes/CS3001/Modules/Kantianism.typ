= Kantianism / Deontology

Unlike utilitarianism, Kantianism is not concerned with outcomes. Instead, the motive for why you did certain actions is more important. 

== Duties 

#definition[
  *Perfect duties* are duties we are obligated to fulfill in every instance. *Imperfect duties* we are obligated to fulfill in general but not in every instance. 
]

== Imperatives

An *imperative* is a way in which reason commands will. 

#definition[
  A *hypothetical imperative* is a conditional rule of the form "If you want X then do Y"
  A *categorical imperative* is a unconditional rule: a rule that always applies, regardless of circumstance. For Kant, only a categorical imperative can be a moral imperative. 
]

Both of the _main two categorical imperatives_ should be held for an act to be considered morally right.
+ Act only from moral rules that you can at the same time will to be universal laws
+ Act so that you always treat both yourself and other people as ends in themselves, and never only as a means to an end

*The Case For*: 
- It treats all person as moral equals 
- It gives all persons moral worth by considering them rational, autonomous beings
- Everyone is held to the same standard 
- Kantianism produces universal moral guidelines

*The Case Against*:
- Sometimes no single rule can fully characterize an action 
- Sometimes there is no way to resolve a conflict between rules 
- Kantianism allows no exceptions to perfect duties
