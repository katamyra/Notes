= Quote 
#blockquote[
  "To possess a virtue is to be a certain sort of person with a certain complex mindset."
]

The quote underscores the idea that virtues are not superficial qualities that can be acquired or discarded at will, but rather integral aspects of a person's identity. *It suggests that virtues shape how individuals perceive and respond to the world around them, influencing their thoughts, feelings, desires, and choices in a consistent and integrated manner.*

Furthermore, the notion of a "complex mindset" highlights the multifaceted nature of virtues, encompassing a broad range of considerations and reasons for action. Virtuous individuals are depicted as possessing a deep understanding of the principles underlying their virtues and applying them across various domains of life.



= Hate Speech 

== For Banning Hate Speech 
+ Protection of Vulnerable Groups: Hate speech can target and marginalize vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities, religious communities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and others. Making it illegal helps to protect these groups from discrimination, harassment, and violence.

+ Promotion of Social Cohesion: Prohibiting hate speech can foster a more inclusive and cohesive society by discouraging the spread of divisive and harmful ideologies that seek to divide communities along lines of race, religion, ethnicity, or other characteristics.

+ Prevention of Incitement to Violence: Hate speech often contains inflammatory rhetoric that can incite violence or discrimination against targeted groups. Banning hate speech can help prevent such incitement and mitigate the risk of hate crimes.

+ Preservation of Human Dignity: Everyone has the right to dignity and respect, and hate speech undermines these fundamental values by dehumanizing and demeaning individuals based on their identity. Making hate speech illegal reinforces the principle of treating all individuals with dignity and equality.

== Against Banning Hate Speech
+ Protection of Free Speech: Freedom of speech is a foundational principle in many democratic societies, including the United States. Allowing hate speech to be legal ensures that individuals have the right to express their opinions and beliefs, even if they are unpopular or offensive to others.

+ Avoidance of Slippery Slope: Prohibiting hate speech could set a precedent for restricting other forms of expression deemed offensive or controversial. Some argue that allowing hate speech to remain legal protects against the erosion of free speech rights more broadly.

+ Facilitation of Debate and Discourse: Permitting hate speech, within certain limits, can facilitate open debate and discussion on contentious issues. It allows individuals to challenge and criticize prevailing beliefs, ideologies, and social norms, which can ultimately lead to greater understanding and progress.

+ Empowerment of Counter-Speech: Instead of banning hate speech outright, some argue for promoting counter-speech and robust societal responses to hateful rhetoric. This approach empowers individuals and communities to challenge hateful ideas through education, dialogue, and advocacy, rather than relying on legal restrictions.

= Term Proposal

Bring up the issue of how social platforms such as twitter bring up tons of different moral issues such as their AI algorithms that amplify hate speech or allow hate speech to roam free and the idea of how as as a technological artifact they can cause lots of social good yet bad at the same time. So I would focus on how in the future we can have laws or proposals that can balance the power of these social platforms with making sure they stay ethical.

+ should/how can companies moderate hate speech 
+ hate speech being amplified and radicalized by AI algorithms 
+ AI algorithms filtering out people's opinions
