= Social Epistemology 

- *Social Epistemology* examines how we form our beliefs and how social factors makeup these beliefs. 

== Internal Realism 

#definition[
  *Internal realism* is a branch of philosophy that arises in response to the debate between scientific realism and anti-realism.
  
  *Scientific Realism* asserts that there exists an objective reality independent of human perception or interpretation, while *anti-realism* denies the existence of such an independent reality.
  
  Specifically in the context of moral actions, *internal realism rejects the idea of a fixed and scientific reality. Instead, that scientific theories are formulated within specific schemes/languages, meaning that moral actions depend on your specific scheme/language.*
  In internal realism, one beliefs that while scientific theories and objective reality are not fully 1-1 correlated, scientific theories are still valid in producing descriptions of the world.

== Social Construction of Knowledge
#definition[
  *The social construction of knowledge* is the idea that knowledge is created not objectively but rather is created within a specific social construct. This means that knowledge is produced/created within communities or institutions. This means that factors such as the language knowledge is learned in, the culture framework within one thinks, or the social norms of that point in time all affect ones knowledge.

  #example[
    One example of how social constructs influence our social construction of knowledge is the idea of tatoos. Some cultures such as traditional Asian cultures view tatoo's with taboo because of the yakuza, and equate tatoos to crime (this is their knowledge being constructed by their social surroundings). However, other cultures such as polynesian cultures have tatoos as a long standing tradition that are important to their status or cultural heritage.

  Furthermore, ones knowledge is also impacted by communicating and interactions with others, further showing how you can gain knowledge based on your own social construction.

== Internet

+ One thing that the internet does well is that it provides the options to see many unique perspectives from different people that they wouldn't find in their close circles. This means that ones options can be a lot more varied or diverse than that if their social construct was purely formed by their close community. 

+ One thing the internet could do better is to help stop echo chambers in social media sites that indirectly "hide" some more unique perspectives sometimes. 
+ I would redesign the internet to stop AI algorithms from biasing certain viewpoints so much that they create echo chambers on social media sites. 

+ We can also use AI algorithms to fact check information that people put on the internet. This could help eliminate or flag fake knowledge that people put out to be deceiving. 

== Intellectual Property
*Trademarks* is a form of IP that specifically protects names, symbols, or any time of identifiers that are used to identify products or services. 

*Patents* is a form of IP that specifically gives exclusivity to inventions. 

*Copyright* is a form of IP that protects original artwork/mediums that were created by people so they cant simply be copied.
